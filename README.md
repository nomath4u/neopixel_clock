Binary clock based on neopixels.

To set the time currently you need to ground pin 10 and it will ad minutes for
you quickly and then just stop when you are where you need to be.

If you don't like having the background lights to see which ones are off then change light magenta to all 0s.

Based on a 30 pixel strip but as long as you have 20 in a row it will work fine.
